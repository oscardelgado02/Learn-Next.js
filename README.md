 Self-learning project to learn to build full-stack applications in Next.js, a React framework.

### [Link to the course I followed](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app)

## Interesting topics from the course:


## Install Next.js:
- In the root of the project, run:

```cmd
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest next@latest
```

- You can also start from an example project:
```cmd
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```
